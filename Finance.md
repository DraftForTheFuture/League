## League Dues
- $50 per year per team
- At startup each team pays the first two years of dues ($100)
- Each subsequent year each team pays $50 for the next year
  - Keeping all teams paid one year in advance will make it easier to find replacement managers if necessary.
- If a manager leaves the league they forfeit their league dues and any stake in future winnings
  - Any league dues forfeited will go towards the dues owed by the replacement manager

## Payouts

All league dues for a given year (12 teams * $50 = $600) will be paid out as follows:

| Payout  |  |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| League Champion | $400 |
| Second Place | $150 |
| Third Place | $50 |

## Money Vault

The safest way to collect and payout money is a league vault. This league is using [TeamStake](https://teamstake.com/), though we can change in the future as necessary.

- TeamStake has [several options](https://teamstake.com/home/faq_detail/4) for payments and payouts
- There is a separate TeamStake League for each NFL season (links below)
- Payouts will be assigned by the commissioner but will require a majority vote from league members to confirm that the money is being paid out correctly.
