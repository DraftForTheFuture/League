# Doc Brown's 2021 Startup Draft Review 

I'd like to welcome everyone to the 2021 season and kick off with a quick draft review post. I've just come back from the year 2041 and want to share some of my favorite picks from this draft and let you know which year those players are going to have their best seasons.



## Round 1
### **Patrick Mahomes**
Best year: 2021

Is it possible to overpay for the consensus top quarterback in a Super Flex? I'll have to agree with **To the Mooney** and say no, no it is not. We saw maximum points in 2021 before Kelce started his inevitable decline.


### **Najee Harris**
Best year: 2023

**Griff Tannen Gang** made a bold move to take the first rookie off the board in the first round. Najee had 5 seasons as a top 5 running back before holding out for a year and signing with the Jets.

## Round 2



### **CeeDee Lamb**
Best years: 2022-2032

If my calculations are correct, when number 88 hits 2022 we're going to see some serious shit.
