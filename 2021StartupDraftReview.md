# Doc Brown's 2021 Startup Draft Review 

I'd like to welcome everyone to the 2021 season and kick off with a quick draft review post. I've just come back from the year 2041 and want to share some of my favorite picks from this draft and let you know which year those players are going to have their best seasons.



## Round 1
### **Patrick Mahomes**
Best year: 2021

Is it possible to overpay for the consensus top quarterback in a Super Flex? I'll have to agree with **To the Mooney** and say no, no it is not. We saw maximum points in 2021 before Kelce started his inevitable decline.


### **Najee Harris**
Best year: 2023

**Griff Tannen Gang** made a bold move to take the first rookie off the board in the first round. Najee had 5 seasons as a top 5 running back before holding out for a year and signing with the Jets.

## Round 2

### **CeeDee Lamb**
Best years: 2022-2032

If my calculations are correct, when number 88 hits 2022 we're going to see some serious shit.

### **Stefon Diggs**
Best year: 2022

Diggs is a beast who is finally getting the targets he deserves. **4th Dimension** was smart to pair Allen and Diggs in the first two rounds, they'll go on to combine for 3,500 points over the next 5 seasons.


## Round 3

### **Kyle Pitts**
Best year: 2025

The chance of being the biggest ever bust at TE scared everyone off in the first two rounds, but **Rogue** pounced to start the third round. By 2027 Kyle Pitts will have accumulated 71 touchdowns, 7,000 yards, and been a top 5 TE for five consecutive years. He will also still be younger than Calvin Ridley is today.


## Round 4

### **Chris Godwin**
Best year: 2023

Godwin is a top tier talent and only 25 years old, an absolute steal in the fourth round by **Mad Dog**. Tampa Bay let their older receivers go and committed to Godwin after 2021 and he retired a Buc with Tom Brady in 2030.


## Round 5

### **Tee Higgins**
Best year: 2024

The spotlight faded on Higgins' stellar rookie season after Drop'Marr Chase was drafted with the fifth overall pick. When Higgins slipped to the fifth round of the startup **1.21 Gigawatts** plugged in Mr. Fusion and put the spotlight back on the 22 year old. Higgins will go on to seven seasons inside the top 24 fantasy wide receivers, topping out at #8 in 2024.


## Round 6

### **Zach Wilson**
Best year: 2025

Zach Wilson will quickly jump up to be a first round pick in startup leagues next year much like Josh Allen. Being a Jet helped him slip to the sixth round and **Enchantment Under the Sea** took advantage of the discount. Nobody wanted a Bills quarterback two years ago either.

### **Josh Jacobs**
Best year: 2022

We must really hate Jon Gruden's offense. Jacobs was RB8 last year. Jacobs is 26 days older than Najee Harris. Days, not years. Jacobs went in the sixth round.

## Round 7

### **Josh Jacobs**
Best year: 2022

We must really hate Jon Gruden's offense. Jacobs was RB8 last year. Jacobs is 26 days older than Najee Harris. Days, not years. Jacobs went in the sixth round.
