## FAQ
 - Will the draft pause overnight?
   - No, the extended 12 hour clock should eliminate the need for manually pausing the draft.
- What if I know I won't be available to make an upcoming pick due?
    - Two options:
      - Set your queue up with the players you want and set to auto pick.
      - Post the details in the league chat and we will try to accommodate you.
- Can all the rookies go on my taxi squad?
  - Every rookie that is drafted can go on a taxi squad.
  - Undrafted rookies are not eligible for the taxi squad.
- When will Free Agency begin?
  - 2 days after the conclusion of the draft. All Free Agents will be placed on waivers to allow FAAB bidding after the draft.
- Who should I draft?
  - I have no idea, but remember this is a **Dynasty SuperFlex Tight End Premium** league. All of the bolded words affect player values.
