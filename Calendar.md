- You will play **two games each week** of the Regular Season
    1. One against your scheduled opponent
    2. One against the league median score
       1. [What?](https://support.sleeper.app/en/articles/3971690-extra-game-each-week-against-league-median)
       2. Basically if you are top 6 in points for the week you get an extra win, if you are bottom 6 you get an extra loss. See above for details.

## Playoffs
  - Playoff Seeding by record, top 6 teams make playoffs
    - Tiebreakers and [details set by Sleeper](https://support.sleeper.app/en/articles/2203518-how-do-playoff-teams-get-determined)
  - Single week Head-to-Head playoff bracket

| Playoff Schedule  |  |

| NFL Week 16 | lowest remaining seed v #1 ; highest remaining seed v #2 |

## Toilet Bowl
- The consolation bracket for the 6 teams that don't make the playoffs is purely for bragging rights. It does not affect rookie draft order or payouts.
- Sleeper Toilet Bowl means that the losing teams in the Toilet Bowl advance to the next round....you want to win and be eliminated. The last team remaining is technically last....although there is no penalty in this league except for shame.
