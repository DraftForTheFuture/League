## Taxi Squad
### Up to 20 players (Zero until 2022 draft)

A Taxi squad gives teams extra roster space to keep developing players. Taxi squads can be handled many different ways so this section will clearly spell out the details of the taxi squad for this league.

The 20 player taxi squad in this league is designed to increase the value of rookie draft picks (especially rounds 3-5) by allowing you to keep the players you draft for up to two years before they need to be moved to your active roster.

    - Taxi squad players may be traded but must land on an active roster, they cannot be moved to a different taxi squad.

     - This is to avoid issues with players trying to load their taxi squads in the startup draft. The large taxi squad it meant to allow teams to build through the rookie draft in subsequent seasons.

   - 2021: 0
   - 2022 and beyond: 20
