## Taxi Squad
A Taxi squad gives teams extra roster space to keep developing players. Taxi squads can be handled many different ways so this section will clearly spell out the details of the taxi squad rules and their intent.

The taxi squad in this league is designed to increase the value of rookie picks (especially rounds 3-5) by allowing you to keep the players you draft for up to two years before they need to be moved to your active roster.

1. Players can only be added to the taxi squad before the start of their rookie season.
   1. Rookies you drafted or traded for can be added to your taxi squad before the start of their rookie season.
   2. After the start of the season players cannot be added to your taxi squad regardless of how they are acquired.
2. A player can only be on your taxi squad for their first two seasons after being drafted.
   1. Players heading into their third year must move off the taxi squad (promoted to active roster, traded, or released) before the start of the regular season.
   2. The Sleeper rule that controls this is `TAXI SQUAD YEARS EXPERIENCE LIMIT = 1 YEAR`
      1. The wording on this setting can be confusing, but the rules in this section take precedence. If you have questions just ask in league chat.
3. Players can only be moved from the taxi squad to your active roster, not from your roster or waiver wire to the taxi squad.
    - Players can be promoted from the taxi squad to your roster at any time.
    - Players can never be moved from your roster to the taxi squad.
        - The only exception to this is moving new rookies to your taxi squad after the rookie draft. The commissioner can help with this if the Sleeper interface makes this difficult.
