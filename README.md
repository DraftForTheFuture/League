## Taxi Squad
A Taxi squad gives you extra roster space to keep developing players. Taxi squads can be handled many different ways so this section will clearly spell out the details of the taxi squad rules and their intent.

1. Only players you draft in the rookie draft can be on your taxi squad.
2. A player can only be on your taxi squad for their first two seasons after being drafted.
3. Players can be promoted from the taxi squad to your roster at any time.
4. Players can never be moved from your roster to the taxi squad.
   1. The only exception to this is moving new rookies to your taxi squad immediately after the rookie draft. The commissioner can help with this if the Sleeper interface makes this difficult.
5. 2021 Season - No Taxi Squad
   - There will be no taxi squad for the initial season
