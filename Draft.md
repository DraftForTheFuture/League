# Draft


## Startup Draft
- 30 round snake draft
- Slow Draft via Sleeper
  - 8 hours per pick
  - Draft paused overnight
  - Auto pick after 8 hours
- Draft order will be randomized via Sleeper when league is filled
- Draft will start shortly after the league is filled

## Rookie Draft
 - Rookie drafts start in 2022
 - 5 round linear (non-snake) draft 
 - Slow Draft via Sleeper
   - 8 hours per pick
   - Draft paused overnight
   - Auto pick after 8 hours
 - Draft order
   - Non-Playoff Teams Picks 1-6
     - Inverse order of Maximum Points For (Max PF) from the previous season
       - Lowest Max PF gets #1 pick
       - Maximum PF means the most points you could have scored if you set a perfect lineup every week. This is a good way to make sure the worst teams get the best draft picks.
   - Playoff Teams picks 7-12

        | Playoff Finish | Draft Pick Slot |
        |:-------------|:------------------|
        | 5 | 7 |
        | 6 | 8 |
        | 4 | 9 |
        | 3 | 10 |
        | 2 | 11 |
        | 1 (Champion) | 12 |
        > This is reverse order of playoff finish EXCEPT for the 5th and 6th place teams. The winner of the 5th/6th place playoff game will get the higher draft pick (gives something to play for in that game).

 - Rookie draft will start approximately 3 weeks after the NFL Draft, or we can vote to start it earlier or later.
