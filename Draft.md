# Rookie Drafts

This page outlines the basics. For details for a specific rookie draft see below.
  - [2022 Rookie Draft](2022RD.md)

## Rookie Draft
 - Rookie drafts start in 2022
 - 5 round linear (non-snake) draft 
 - Slow Draft via Sleeper
   - 12 hours per pick
   - Auto pick after 12 hours
 - Rookie draft will start approximately 3 weeks after the NFL Draft, or we can vote to start it earlier or later.

### Draft order
#### **Non-Playoff Teams: Picks 1-6**
   - Inverse order of Maximum Points For (Max PF) from the previous season
     - Lowest Max PF gets #1 pick
     - Maximum PF means the most points you could have scored if you set a perfect lineup every week. This is a good way to make sure the worst teams get the best draft picks.

#### **Playoff Teams: Picks 7-12**

| Playoff Finish | Draft Pick Slot |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| 5 | 7 |
| 6 | 8 |
| 4 | 9 |
| 3 | 10 |
| 2 | 11 |
| 1 (Champion) | 12 |

> This is reverse order of playoff finish EXCEPT for the 5th and 6th place teams. The winner of the 5th/6th place playoff game will get the higher draft pick (gives something to play for in that game).
